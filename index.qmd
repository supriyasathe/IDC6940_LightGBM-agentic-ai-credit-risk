title: "Explainable Agentic AI for Credit Risk Assessment"
subtitle: "Weekly Progress Report - Week 5"
date: "February 9, 2026"
---

## Introduction
In financial institutions, evaluating credit risk is essential as it directly impacts lending choices, portfolio performance, and regulatory compliance. Traditional models, such as logistic regression, are widely used due to their simplicity and interpretability. However, they struggle to capture the complex, non-linear correlations inherent in modern financial data.

This study proposes an **Explainable Agentic AI framework** utilizing **LightGBM** to bridge the gap between high-performance predictive modeling and the transparency required by regulators.

## Methods

-   Detail the models or algorithms used.

-   Justify your choices based on the problem and data.

*The common non-parametric regression model is*
$Y_i = m(X_i) + \varepsilon_i$*, where* $Y_i$ *can be defined as the sum
of the regression function value* $m(x)$ *for* $X_i$*. Here* $m(x)$ *is
unknown and* $\varepsilon_i$ *some errors. With the help of this
definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e.*
$m(x)$ *can be estimated with the product of* $Y_i$ *average and* $X_i$
*is near to* $x$*. In other words, this means that we are discovering
the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data
points. The estimation formula is printed below [@R-base]:*

$$
M_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \tag{1}
$$$W_n(x)$ *is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers.
Weights are positive numbers and small if* $X_i$ *is far from* $x$*.*

*Another equation:*

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 +\varepsilon_i
$$

## Analysis and Results

### Data Exploration and Visualization

-   Describe your data sources and collection process.

-   Present initial findings and insights through visualizations.

-   Highlight unexpected patterns or anomalies.

A study was conducted to determine how...

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=T, message=FALSE}
# loading packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
library(dslabs)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load Data
kable(head(murders))

ggplot1 = murders %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=population/10^6, y=total)) 

  ggplot1 + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=abb)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y~x", method=lm,se = F)+
  xlab("Populations in millions (log10 scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log10 scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region")+
      theme_bw()
  

```

### Modeling and Results

-   Explain your data preprocessing and cleaning steps.

-   Present your key findings in a clear and concise manner.

-   Use visuals to support your claims.

-   **Tell a story about what the data reveals.**

```{r}

```

### Conclusion

-   Summarize your key findings.

-   Discuss the implications of your results.
